Image Captioning Neural Network notebook using Keras.

## Dataset Installation Instructions

You can install the images on the Kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k). Place the `Image` directory that comes with it into the `flickr8k` directory in this repository. The captions are already in the `flickr8k` dataset.

You can install the GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/glove-global-vectors-for-word-representation?select=glove.6B.200d.txt). Paste that in the `glove` directory.
